## PSA Security Guide

PSA, for the most part, is a wrapper of other components.

As such, it has a low probability of having a security hole.

As those are famous lasts words, if you believe that PSA presents a unique security concern, please file an issue.

If you have a security concern about the At Protocol, please consult their [Security documentation](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
