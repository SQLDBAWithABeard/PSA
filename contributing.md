## PSA Contribution Guide

PSA welcomes careful contributions.

To get started, please file an issue to track what you'd like to change.

Most of the commands in PSA are automatically generated.

To change these commands, you'll need to edit the PSA Build file (PSA.Build.ps1).

The execeptions to the rule are:

* Invoke-AtProto
* Connect-AtProto
* Send-AtProto

You can also extend the types and formatting available in PSA.

These files are located beneath `Types/`.
